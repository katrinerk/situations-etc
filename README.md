# Reading list: Situations, Scripts, Narrative Schemas, Scenes, Generalized Event Knowledge, 

## Scripts in Psychology and Artificial Intelligence

Minsky

Schank & Abelson 1977: typical sequence of events with participants, e.g. restaurant script

Liechtenstein/Brewer 1980, Abbott/Black/Smith 1985, Austin/Vancouver 1996: Scripts consisting of scenes, segmented by participants’ goals 

## Generalized Event Knowledge in psychology

Elman

Selectional preferences as concepts with typical features: McRae/Ferretti/Amyote 1997. 

“young naive gambler” is a more likely Theme than Agent of “manipulate”
An event with all of its participants: Bicknell et al 2008, Hare et al 2009, McRae/Matsuki 2009. 

“mechanic checks brakes” is more expected than “mechanic checks spelling” 
Loosely co-occurring objects and events: Metusalem et al 2012

## Situations, frames and scripts in linguistics

### Situation semantics

Situation semantics was introduced by Barwise and Perry, see [Barwise and Perry 1983](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/S/bo3625416.html).
For overviews, see [Kratzer 2021, Situations in Natural Language Semantics ](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/situations-semantics/) and [Stojanovic 2012, Situation Semantics](https://hal.science/file/index/docid/629850/filename/situationsemantics.pdf). [Devlin 2006, Situation Theory and Situation Semantics](https://web.stanford.edu/~kdevlin/Papers/HHL_SituationTheory.pdf) gives an overview of the formalization.

Kratzer: "Situation semantics was developed as an alternative to possible worlds semantics. In situation semantics, linguistic expressions are evaluated with respect to partial, rather than complete, worlds. There is no consensus about what situations are, just as there is no consensus about what possible worlds or events are. According to some, situations are structured entities consisting of relations and individuals standing in those relations. According to others, situations are particular"

Stojanovic describes situation theory as "breaking off with the Fregean heritage"

* Primacy of situations. "reality consists primarily of situations, while other categories, such as individuals, properties, or locations, arise as uniformities across situations"
* Partiality: "information is [...] partial"
* Efficiency of language: "same words can be used in different contexts to mean different things"
* A relational theory of meaning: "the idea that meaning should be seen as a relation between situations, rather than some kind of independent entity"
* Uniformities and constraints: "agents get attuned to various kinds of uniformities, which allow them to classify the reality in ways that enhance their capacities for action". "constraints are then seen as uniformities that arise among the ways in which situations relate to one another
* The reference relation and its relata: "instead of taking reference to be a relation between a *sentence* and its *truth value*, it takes it to be a relation between *utterances* and (other) situations; secondly, instead of taking reference to be a relation between a *name* [...] and an *individual*, it takes it to be a relation again between utterances [...] and other situations"
* Truth as uniformity across situations: "truth is merely a device that helps us classify situations"
* Semantic innocence and attitude reports: "one of the main motivations is that the embedded clause [...] should have the same meaning as it does when it occurs on its own"



Barwise/Perry, Kratzer, Stojanovic

### Situations, frames, and scripts and sentence understanding

Fillmore: Frames are chunks of background information that are being evoked whenever you hear a word (or construction)
frames as comprising schemas, scripts, situations

Fillmore, Recanati point to importance of script knowledge in sentence understanding

### Situations in probabilistic semantics

Dobnik/Cooper/Lappin/Larsson: situations as atomic, with probabilistic propositions as types

Lassiter/Goodman: generative model of situations, size based on question under discussion

## Narrative schemas and scripts in computational linguistics
