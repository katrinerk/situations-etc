## Scripts in Psychology and Artificial Intelligence

Minsky

Schank & Abelson 1977: typical sequence of events with participants, e.g. restaurant script

Liechtenstein/Brewer 1980, Abbott/Black/Smith 1985, Austin/Vancouver 1996: Scripts consisting of scenes, segmented by participants’ goals 

## Generalized Event Knowledge in psychology

Elman

Selectional preferences as concepts with typical features: McRae/Ferretti/Amyote 1997. 

“young naive gambler” is a more likely Theme than Agent of “manipulate”
An event with all of its participants: Bicknell et al 2008, Hare et al 2009, McRae/Matsuki 2009. 

“mechanic checks brakes” is more expected than “mechanic checks spelling” 
Loosely co-occurring objects and events: Metusalem et al 2012

## Situations, frames and scripts in linguistics

### Situation semantics

Barwise/Perry, Kratzer, Stojanovic

### Situations, frames, and scripts and sentence understanding

Fillmore: Frames are chunks of background information that are being evoked whenever you hear a word (or construction)
frames as comprising schemas, scripts, situations

Fillmore, Recanati point to importance of script knowledge in sentence understanding

### Situations in probabilistic semantics

Dobnik/Cooper/Lappin/Larsson: situations as atomic, with probabilistic propositions as types

Lassiter/Goodman: generative model of situations, size based on question under discussion

## Narrative schemas and scripts in computational linguistics
